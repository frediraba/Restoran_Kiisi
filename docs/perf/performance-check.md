# Performance Validation Log

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-05 09:17 +03:00

| Command | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run build -- --profile` | Failed | Turbopack build stops due to `src/lib/observability/slo.ts` importing non-existent `metrics` export from `@vercel/otel`; no profile artifacts emitted. See `build-profile-2025-10-05.log`. |
| `npm run test:lh` | Not Run (Placeholder) | Script currently echoes "Lighthouse smoke pending manual run"; no Lighthouse automation configured. See `lighthouse-smoke-2025-10-05.log`. |

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Adjust observability helper to rely on supported `@vercel/otel` API (e.g., `trace` or `getTracer`) or upgrade dependency providing metrics exporter.
2. Decide whether to wire actual Lighthouse smoke test or update script to fail early until implemented.
