## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What platform should the "Order" experience hand off to once a guest chooses pickup/delivery? -> A: Built-in first-party ordering.
- Q: When a reservation request exceeds available capacity for the chosen time, how should the site respond? -> A: Suggest nearest available time slots at the same location.
- Q: If a guest tries to start an order outside service hours, what should the experience do? -> A: Block ordering and display a "kitchen closed" message with hours.
- Q: What is the primary purpose of the “Account” tab in the mobile navigation? -> A: Manage logged-in guest profiles with saved orders and payment details.
- Q: How should guests authenticate to access the Account area? -> A: Email/password managed by Kiisi.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### Primary User Story
A hungry guest visits restoran Kiisi online to browse signature dishes, place a takeaway order, and optionally reserve a table at a nearby location in one continuous journey.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a first-time visitor on desktop, **When** they open the navigation and choose "Menu", **Then** they see categorized dishes with pricing and tags that match printed menus.
2. **Given** a guest on mobile who taps the "Reserve" tab, **When** they submit party size, date, and preferred location, **Then** they receive confirmation messaging or a clear follow-up action within three steps.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user selects "Order" outside service hours? Block ordering and display kitchen closed hours messaging.
- How does the system handle reservations that exceed table capacity or overlapping time slots? Display nearest available times at the same location.
- What if a promotional Offer expires but is still linked in secondary navigation?
- How should the experience communicate pay-on-site expectations when an order is submitted?

## Rendering & Performance Guardrails *(mandatory)*

**Rendering Intent**: Public marketing routes (`/`, `/menu`, `/locations`, `/offers`) partially prerendered with streaming to showcase hero imagery quickly; transactional flows (`/order`, `/reserve`, `/account`) dynamic with Suspense boundaries around data-capture steps.  
**Caching Strategy**: Static content revalidates every 24 hours with tag-based invalidation when menu items or promotions change; transactional endpoints bypass cache and tag responses for order/reservation confirmation.  
**Performance Budgets**: TTFB <=200ms for prerendered pages, <=300ms for dynamic order/reservation steps; LCP <=2.5s on homepage and menu; interaction-ready milestones within 100ms for tab changes.  
**Edge & Observability**: Deploy marketing pages on Edge runtime with instrumentation.ts tracing for nav usage, order/reserve funnel, and error states; provide graceful fallbacks (error.tsx, not-found.tsx) for unavailable services.
