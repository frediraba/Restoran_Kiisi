# Implementation Plan: Deploy Project to Vercel

**Branch**: `002-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**: specs/002-i-want-to/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Summary
- Enable automated production deployments of the Next.js application to the Vercel Hobby plan using the `main` branch as the release trigger.
- Document and provision required environment variables (PlanetScale and NextAuth) so builds succeed in the hosted environment.
- Provide recovery guidance for failed deployments and a private validation workflow for the maintainer via the Vercel dashboard.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Node.js 20 (Next.js 15 Turbopack)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15.5.4, React 19.1, NextAuth credentials provider, Prisma ORM, PlanetScale MySQL
**Storage**: PlanetScale (MySQL) via Prisma
**Testing**: `npm test` (Vitest), `npm run lint`, optional Playwright smoke tests
**Target Platform**: Vercel Hobby (production region `fra1`)
**Project Type**: Web (Next.js application with app router)
**Performance Goals**: Maintain current production performance; monitor Vercel build minutes within Hobby limits
**Constraints**: Must fit Hobby quotas (build time, bandwidth, serverless execution); manual rollback only; secrets managed through Vercel
**Scale/Scope**: Single maintainer workflow; stakeholders limited to deployment owner for validation

## Constitution Check
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` currently contains placeholder sections with no enforceable principles; treat as a governance gap.
- Action: Project leadership must ratify a real constitution before implementation to avoid ambiguity in future gates.
- Proceeding with plan under assumption that no additional constitutional constraints apply beyond standard quality practices.

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js web application rooted in `src/app`; no additional packages required for deployment work.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Captured Vercel-required environment variables and Hobby plan guardrails in `research.md`.
- Confirmed deployment trigger (`main`), region (`fra1`), and manual failure handling expectations per clarifications.
- Documented private validation flow (dashboard-only URL) and noted optional maintenance toggle.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Documented configuration-focused entities (`EnvironmentVariable`, `DeploymentConfiguration`) in `data-model.md` to formalize deployment checklist requirements.
- Authored `contracts/vercel-deployment.md` to describe the Git-to-Vercel pipeline, required inputs, and failure handling contract.
- Added `quickstart.md` with a reproducible setup and rollout sequence, including manual rollback instructions.
- Ran `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType codex` to keep `AGENTS.md` aligned with current plan context.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- `/tasks` will generate items that: document env variables in repo docs, configure Vercel project settings, wire `main` branch auto-deploy, update CI/CD notes, and validate deployment via dashboard.
- Expected ordering: update documentation (research findings -> quickstart) before executing Vercel configuration, then add monitoring/verification tasks. Mark parallelizable documentation updates with `[P]` and sequence Vercel configuration before validation checks.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
- Phase 3 (`/tasks`): produce actionable steps covering documentation updates, Vercel project configuration, and verification.
- Phase 4: Execute tasks, update Vercel settings, and validate production deployment.
- Phase 5: Run regression tests (`npm run lint`, `npm test`), confirm dashboard status, and record completion signal.

## Complexity Tracking
| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Constitution missing enforceable principles | Enables plan progress despite governance gap | Blocking plan would stall deployment; project must ratify constitution separately |
